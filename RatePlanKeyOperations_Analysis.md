## Overview

This document provides detailed analysis of the four key operations in the Altaworx SIM Card Cost Optimization System's rate plan processing: Type Classification, Diversity Maintenance, Balanced Generation, and Type-Specific Optimization.

## 1. Type Classification

### What, Who, How Analysis

#### What
**What does Type Classification do?**
- Groups rate plans by their service type (data, voice, SMS, messaging, etc.)
- Categorizes plans based on service characteristics and metadata
- Creates indexed collections for efficient type-based access
- Assigns primary and secondary type classifications to each rate plan
- Establishes type hierarchies for complex service combinations

#### Who
**Who uses Type Classification?**
- **GenerateRatePoolSequencesByRatePlanTypes()** - Primary consumer that uses type groupings for sequence generation
- **Rate plan configuration managers** - Set up and maintain type definitions and classification rules
- **Mobility optimization engine** - Uses type classifications for mobile-specific optimization workflows
- **Business rule processors** - Apply type-specific constraints and validation rules
- **Reporting systems** - Generate type-based analytics and optimization reports
- **Service catalog administrators** - Maintain type taxonomies and service categorizations

#### How
**How does Type Classification work?**
- Analyzes rate plan metadata to identify service characteristics
- Applies classification algorithms based on service indicators (data allowances, voice minutes, messaging limits)
- Creates type mappings and maintains indexed collections for fast lookup
- Validates type assignments against business rules and constraints
- Updates classification indices when new plans are added or modified

### Algorithm Description

```
TYPE CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM:

INPUT: Collection of rate plans with service metadata

PROCESS:
1. METADATA ANALYSIS
   - Extract service indicators from plan details
   - Identify data allowances, voice minutes, SMS limits
   - Detect bundled service combinations
   - Analyze pricing structure patterns

2. TYPE ASSIGNMENT
   - Apply classification rules based on service indicators:
     * Data Plans: Plans with data allowances > 0
     * Voice Plans: Plans with voice minutes > 0  
     * SMS Plans: Plans with messaging allowances > 0
     * Bundle Plans: Plans with multiple service types
     * IoT Plans: Low-data, machine-focused plans
   - Assign primary type (dominant service)
   - Assign secondary types (additional services)

3. VALIDATION
   - Verify type assignments against business rules
   - Check for classification conflicts or ambiguities
   - Apply manual overrides where specified

4. INDEX CREATION
   - Create type-based lookup indices
   - Build cross-reference mappings
   - Optimize for query performance

OUTPUT: Type-classified rate plan collections with indexed access
```

### Code Location and Usage

#### Primary Implementation
