## Detailed Process Flow

### Phase 1: Optimization Initiation and Scheduling

#### 1.1 Automatic Trigger Logic
The system automatically initiates optimization runs based on sophisticated scheduling logic:

**Timing Conditions:**
- **Standard Window**: Last 8 days of the billing period
- **Final Day Logic**: Continuous execution on the last day starting from the configured hour
- **Billing Period Calculation**: Uses service provider's billing cycle end date and local time zone

**Service Provider Selection:**
The system queries active Jasper service providers and evaluates each for optimization eligibility.

**Database Tables Involved:**
- `ServiceProvider` - Contains active service providers with integration settings
- `JasperAuthentication` - Stores API credentials and billing period configurations
- `OptimizationSession` - Tracks optimization sessions and their status
- `vwOptimizationSessionRunning` - View showing currently running optimization sessions

#### 1.2 Pre-Execution Validation
Before starting any optimization, the system performs comprehensive validation:

**Concurrent Execution Check:**
