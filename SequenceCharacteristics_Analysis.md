   // Creates enumerable of sequence arrays, each with batchSize elements

3. BATCH_PROCESSING:
   foreach (var sequences in ratePoolBatches):
       // Create SQS message attributes for batch
       attributes = {
           RATE_PLAN_SEQUENCES: JsonSerializer.Serialize(sequences),
           COMM_GROUP_ID: commGroupId.ToString()
