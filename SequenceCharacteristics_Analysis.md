## 1. Ordering

### What, Why, How Analysis

#### What
**What does Sequence Ordering do?**
- Arranges sequences by cost-effectiveness with lowest potential cost first
- Prioritizes sequences with highest optimization potential for early processing
- Orders rate plan combinations based on estimated cost savings and efficiency metrics
- Ensures most promising sequences are processed before less optimal alternatives
- Provides systematic ranking of sequence effectiveness for resource allocation

#### Why
**Why is Sequence Ordering needed?**
- **Maximizes cost savings potential** by processing most promising sequences first before system resources are exhausted
- **Improves optimization efficiency** by focusing computational resources on sequences with highest return on investment
- **Enables early termination** when resource limits are reached while ensuring best sequences have been processed
- **Provides predictable results** by establishing consistent ranking criteria across different optimization scenarios
- **Reduces processing time** by identifying optimal solutions faster through priority-based processing
- **Supports business objectives** by ensuring cost-effective sequences receive processing priority over less valuable alternatives

#### How
**How does Sequence Ordering work?**
- Calculates cost-effectiveness metrics for each generated sequence
- Applies ranking algorithms based on potential cost savings and optimization efficiency
- Orders sequences from lowest potential cost to highest for optimal processing priority
- Maintains sequence order throughout the optimization pipeline
- Provides consistent ordering criteria across different optimization scenarios

### Algorithm Description

```
SEQUENCE ORDERING ALGORITHM:

INPUT: 
- Set of generated rate plan sequences S = {s₁, s₂, ..., sₙ}
- Cost calculation parameters C
- Optimization potential metrics M

ALGORITHM:
1. COST_EFFECTIVENESS_EVALUATION:
   For each sequence sᵢ ∈ S:
   - Compute total implementation cost: cost(sᵢ)
   - Calculate potential savings: savings(sᵢ) = current_cost - cost(sᵢ)
   - Determine efficiency ratio: efficiency(sᵢ) = savings(sᵢ) / cost(sᵢ)
   - Assess device coverage impact: coverage(sᵢ)

2. OPTIMIZATION_POTENTIAL_MEASUREMENT:
   - Evaluate sequence diversity score: diversity(sᵢ)
   - Measure usage pattern alignment: alignment(sᵢ)
   - Calculate pooling benefit coefficient: pooling(sᵢ)
   - Determine service compatibility index: compatibility(sᵢ)

3. COMPOSITE_SCORING:
   - Define weighting vector: W = [w₁, w₂, w₃, w₄]
   - Calculate effectiveness score: 
     effectiveness(sᵢ) = w₁×efficiency(sᵢ) + w₂×diversity(sᵢ) + w₃×alignment(sᵢ) + w₄×pooling(sᵢ)
   - Normalize scores across all sequences: normalized_score(sᵢ)

4. SEQUENCE_ORDERING:
   - Arrange sequences in ascending order of total cost
   - Apply secondary ordering by effectiveness score for ties
   - Maintain deterministic ordering for reproducible results
   - Preserve sequence identifiers and metadata

5. PRIORITY_CLASSIFICATION:
   - Partition ordered sequences into priority levels
   - Assign high priority to top percentile sequences
   - Mark medium priority for middle range sequences
   - Flag low priority for remaining sequences

OUTPUT: 
- Ordered sequence set O = {o₁, o₂, ..., oₙ} where cost(o₁) ≤ cost(o₂) ≤ ... ≤ cost(oₙ)
- Priority classification P = {high, medium, low} for each sequence
- Effectiveness scores E = {e₁, e₂, ..., eₙ}
```

### What, Why, How Analysis

#### What
**What does Sequence Filtering do?**
- Eliminates sequences with incompatible plan combinations
- Removes sequences that violate business rules and constraints

## 3. Limits

### What, Why, How Analysis

#### What
**What do Sequence Limits do?**
- First instance limited by RATE_PLAN_SEQUENCES_FIRST_INSTANCE_LIMIT to prevent resource exhaustion
- Controls the maximum number of sequences processed in initial optimization runs
- Prevents combinatorial explosion that could overwhelm system resources
- Ensures optimization remains within computational and memory constraints
- Provides scalable processing by managing sequence volume

#### Why
**Why are Sequence Limits needed?**
- **Prevents system overload** by controlling sequence volume to stay within Lambda memory and execution time constraints
- **Enables scalable processing** by automatically triggering distributed processing when sequence counts exceed manageable limits
- **Protects against combinatorial explosion** where rate plan combinations could generate millions of sequences overwhelming system resources
- **Ensures predictable performance** by maintaining consistent execution times regardless of input complexity
- **Optimizes resource utilization** by balancing processing thoroughness with system capacity constraints
- **Provides graceful degradation** by switching to bulk processing mode when limits are exceeded rather than failing

#### How
**How do Sequence Limits work?**
- Applies RATE_PLAN_SEQUENCES_FIRST_INSTANCE_LIMIT during initial sequence generation
- Triggers bulk processing and message queuing when limits are exceeded
- Manages sequence processing across multiple Lambda instances for scalability
- Provides overflow handling for large sequence collections
- Ensures consistent performance regardless of sequence volume

### Algorithm Description

```
SEQUENCE LIMITS ALGORITHM:

INPUT: 
- Sequence collection S with cardinality |S| = n
- First instance limit threshold L₁
- System resource capacity vector R = [memory, time, processing_power]

ALGORITHM:
1. CARDINALITY_ASSESSMENT:
   - Measure sequence count: n = |S|
   - Define limit threshold: L₁ = first_instance_limit
   - Calculate overflow amount: overflow = max(0, n - L₁)

2. THRESHOLD_EVALUATION:
   - Apply limit comparison function: exceeds(n, L₁) = (n > L₁)
   - Determine processing mode:
     * Standard mode: exceeds(n, L₁) = false
     * Distributed mode: exceeds(n, L₁) = true
   - Calculate processing complexity: complexity(S) = f(n, resource_demand(S))

3. PROCESSING_STRATEGY_SELECTION:
   - If n ≤ L₁:
     * Select single-instance processing: mode = STANDARD
     * Allocate full resource set: allocated_resources = R
   - If n > L₁:
     * Select distributed processing: mode = DISTRIBUTED
     * Partition sequence set: S = S₁ ∪ S₂ ∪ ... ∪ Sₖ
     * Queue overflow sequences: queue_sequences = S \ S₁

4. RESOURCE_ALLOCATION:
   - Calculate memory requirement: memory_needed = estimate_memory(S)
   - Estimate processing time: time_needed = estimate_time(S)
   - Apply resource constraints:
     * memory_needed ≤ available_memory
     * time_needed ≤ execution_time_limit
   - Determine batch size: batch_size = optimize_batch(R, complexity(S))

5. OVERFLOW_MANAGEMENT:
   - If overflow > 0:
     * Create overflow partition: S_overflow = {s_{L₁+1}, s_{L₁+2}, ..., sₙ}
     * Initiate distributed processing: distribute(S_overflow)
     * Maintain processing order: preserve_sequence_order(S_overflow)

OUTPUT: 
- Processing mode assignment: mode ∈ {STANDARD, DISTRIBUTED}
- Resource allocation plan: resource_plan = {memory_alloc, time_alloc, instances}
- Overflow handling strategy: overflow_strategy ∈ {queue, batch, distribute}
```

### Code Location and Usage

#### Primary Implementation
- **Constant**: `OptimizationConstant.RATE_PLAN_SEQUENCES_FIRST_INSTANCE_LIMIT`
- **Location**: Used in sequence generation overflow logic

#### Usage Context
```csharp
// File: QueueCarrierPlanOptimization.cs, Line: 662
if (ratePoolSequences.Count > OptimizationConstant.RATE_PLAN_SEQUENCES_FIRST_INSTANCE_LIMIT)
{
    // Remove the comm group id from the list so that we won't queue up message for optimizer
    sameRatePlansCollectionIds.Remove(sameRatePlansCollectionId);
    // Save the optimization queues and map them to sequences
    BulkSaveRatePlanAndSequences(context, serviceProviderId, instance, usesProration, sameRatePlansCollectionId, ratePoolSequences);
    // Queue up new instance for creating rate plan sequences
    await SendMessageToCreateQueueRatePlans(context, ratePoolSequences, sameRatePlansCollectionId);
}
```

## 4. Batching

### What, Why, How Analysis

#### What
**What does Sequence Batching do?**
- Splits sequences into batches of RATE_PLAN_SEQUENCES_BATCH_SIZE for manageable processing
- Organizes large sequence collections into smaller, processable chunks
- Enables parallel processing across multiple Lambda instances or workers
- Prevents memory overflow and timeout issues during sequence processing
- Facilitates distributed processing and improved system scalability

#### Why
**Why is Sequence Batching needed?**
- **Enables horizontal scaling** by distributing large sequence collections across multiple Lambda instances for parallel processing
- **Prevents memory limitations** by breaking large collections into manageable chunks that fit within Lambda memory constraints
- **Avoids timeout issues** by ensuring each batch can be processed within Lambda execution time limits
- **Improves throughput** by allowing simultaneous processing of multiple batches rather than sequential processing
- **Provides fault tolerance** by isolating failures to individual batches rather than entire sequence collections
- **Optimizes SQS usage** by keeping message sizes within limits while maximizing processing efficiency

#### How
**How does Sequence Batching work?**
- Uses RATE_PLAN_SEQUENCES_BATCH_SIZE to determine optimal batch size
- Chunks large sequence collections into manageable batches using the Chunk() method
- Serializes each batch for SQS message transmission
- Processes batches independently across distributed workers
- Maintains batch processing order and integrity throughout the pipeline

### Algorithm Description

```
SEQUENCE BATCHING ALGORITHM:

INPUT: 
- Large sequence collection S with cardinality |S| = n
- Batch size parameter β
- Message capacity constraints M = [max_size, max_count]

ALGORITHM:
1. BATCH_CONFIGURATION:
   - Define batch size: β = batch_size_constant
   - Calculate total sequences: n = |S|
   - Determine number of batches: k = ⌈n/β⌉
   - Estimate batch distribution: batches = {B₁, B₂, ..., Bₖ}

2. SEQUENCE_PARTITIONING:
   - Partition sequence set: S = B₁ ∪ B₂ ∪ ... ∪ Bₖ where Bᵢ ∩ Bⱼ = ∅ for i ≠ j
   - Define batch contents: Bᵢ = {s_{(i-1)β+1}, s_{(i-1)β+2}, ..., s_{min(iβ,n)}}
   - Ensure batch size constraint: |Bᵢ| ≤ β ∀i ∈ {1, 2, ..., k}
   - Maintain sequence ordering within batches

3. BATCH_OPTIMIZATION:
   - Calculate batch load balance: load_variance = var(|B₁|, |B₂|, ..., |Bₖ|)
   - Minimize load imbalance: minimize(load_variance) subject to |Bᵢ| ≤ β
   - Apply size constraints: ensure serialized_size(Bᵢ) ≤ max_message_size
   - Optimize for parallel processing: balance_processing_time(B₁, B₂, ..., Bₖ)

4. MESSAGE_COMPOSITION:
   For each batch Bᵢ:
   - Create message payload: payload(Bᵢ) = serialize(Bᵢ) + metadata(Bᵢ)
   - Validate size constraint: |payload(Bᵢ)| ≤ max_message_size
   - Add batch identifiers: batch_id = (i, k, correlation_id)
   - Include processing metadata: metadata = {batch_number, total_batches, sequence_order}

5. DISTRIBUTED_TRANSMISSION:
   - Transmit batches in parallel: parallel_send(payload(B₁), payload(B₂), ..., payload(Bₖ))
   - Maintain batch ordering: preserve_order = {order(B₁) < order(B₂) < ... < order(Bₖ)}
   - Enable fault tolerance: retry_policy(Bᵢ) for failed transmissions
   - Track completion status: completion_vector = [status(B₁), status(B₂), ..., status(Bₖ)]

OUTPUT: 
- Batch partition set B = {B₁, B₂, ..., Bₖ} where ∪Bᵢ = S
- Message payload collection P = {payload(B₁), payload(B₂), ..., payload(Bₖ)}
- Parallel processing distribution across k independent processing units
```
