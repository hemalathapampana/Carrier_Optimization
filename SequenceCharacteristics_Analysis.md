       triggerBulkProcessing = true
       exceedsLimit = true
   else:
       triggerStandardProcessing = true
       exceedsLimit = false

3. PROCESSING_MODE_SELECTION:
   if (exceedsLimit):
       // Remove from immediate processing queue
       sameRatePlansCollectionIds.Remove(sameRatePlansCollectionId)
       // Trigger bulk operations
       BulkSaveRatePlanAndSequences(context, serviceProviderId, instance, 
           usesProration, sameRatePlansCollectionId, ratePoolSequences)
       // Queue for distributed processing
       await SendMessageToCreateQueueRatePlans(context, ratePoolSequences, sameRatePlansCollectionId)
   else:
       // Standard processing within single instance
       SaveRatePlanAndSequences(context, serviceProviderId, instance, 
           usesProration, sameRatePlansCollectionId, commGroupRatePlanTable, ratePoolSequences)

4. RESOURCE_MANAGEMENT:

{
    // Remove the comm group id from the list so that we won't queue up message for optimizer
    sameRatePlansCollectionIds.Remove(sameRatePlansCollectionId);
    // Save the optimization queues and map them to sequences
    BulkSaveRatePlanAndSequences(context, serviceProviderId, instance, usesProration, sameRatePlansCollectionId, ratePoolSequences);
    // Queue up new instance for creating rate plan sequences
    await SendMessageToCreateQueueRatePlans(context, ratePoolSequences, sameRatePlansCollectionId);
}
```

## 4. Batching

### What, Why, How Analysis

#### What
**What does Sequence Batching do?**
- Splits sequences into batches of RATE_PLAN_SEQUENCES_BATCH_SIZE for manageable processing
- Organizes large sequence collections into smaller, processable chunks

- **Provides fault tolerance** by isolating failures to individual batches rather than entire sequence collections
- **Optimizes SQS usage** by keeping message sizes within limits while maximizing processing efficiency

#### How
**How does Sequence Batching work?**
- Uses RATE_PLAN_SEQUENCES_BATCH_SIZE to determine optimal batch size
- Chunks large sequence collections into manageable batches using the Chunk() method

- Maintains batch processing order and integrity throughout the pipeline

### Algorithm Description

```
SEQUENCE BATCHING ALGORITHM:

INPUT:

ALGORITHM:
1. BATCH_SIZE_DETERMINATION:
   batchSize = OptimizationConstant.RATE_PLAN_SEQUENCES_BATCH_SIZE
   totalSequences = ratePoolSequences.Count
   expectedBatches = Math.Ceiling(totalSequences / batchSize)

2. SEQUENCE_CHUNKING:
   ratePoolBatches = ratePoolSequences.Chunk(batchSize)
   // Creates enumerable of sequence arrays, each with batchSize elements

3. BATCH_PROCESSING:
   foreach (var sequences in ratePoolBatches):
       // Create SQS message attributes for batch
       attributes = {
           RATE_PLAN_SEQUENCES: JsonSerializer.Serialize(sequences),
           COMM_GROUP_ID: commGroupId.ToString()
       }
       // Send batch as SQS message for processing
       await sqsService.SendSQSMessage(logger, credentials, queueUrl, attributes)

4. MESSAGE_SERIALIZATION:
   - Serialize sequence batch to JSON format
   - Include metadata for batch processing
   - Ensure message size stays within SQS limits
   - Add correlation identifiers for tracking

5. DISTRIBUTED_PROCESSING:
